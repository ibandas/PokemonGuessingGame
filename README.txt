Welcome to Pokemon GO++!

By running the game, you are introduced to an introduction that tells you how the game works, and basic commands.
You start the game with "5 Lives". Each incorrect guess and each "hint" costs you a life.
Your goal is to guess each Pokemon, up to completeing level 12, without running out of your lives first.

Every three levels, you are given less information of the Pokemon you need to guess it is.
Levels 1-3 are Easy mode.
Levels 4-6 are Medium mode.
Levels 7-9 are Hard mode.
Levels 10-12 are Legendary mode. 

To begin the game, press Start. Or quit to exit.
It will continue to loop until you type one of these two.

Once the game starts, you are given the first level and the information of the pokemon you need to guess.
You can type the name of the Pokemon you think it is (Capitalized), and if you are correct, you will move on to the next level that will give the new Pokemon.
If the answer is incorrect, it will say "Wrong!" and you will be prompted to give another answer. You will also be told how many lives you have left after you lose one.

You can type "life" to see your current amount of lives again.

You could also type "hint" to see an ASCII image of the Pokemon at the cost of a life. It will tell you that you lost a life.

You can type "help" in order to see all the commands and information of how the game works again.
