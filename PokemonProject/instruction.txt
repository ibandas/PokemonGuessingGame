Game objective: Guess the Pokemon based on hints given from attributes,
types, abilities. The Pokemon are randomized from the list of the first generation, with no repeats.
Note: Make sure every pokemon name is capitalized!!!

If you guess the Pokemon correct, you move on to the next level. Every 3 levels, the game gets continuously harder.
Less information about each pokemon will be given as the game gets harder.

You start with 5 lives. 
Every time you ask for a hint, you will be given a picture of the pokemon at the cost of a life. 

These are your options to type if you're stuck:
quit - Ends the game.
hint - Gives a picture of the Pokemon at the cost of a life.
life - Tells you how many lives you have left.
help - Allows you to see this menu again.

Type "start" to begin the game!!!
